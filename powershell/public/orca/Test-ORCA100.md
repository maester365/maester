The differentiation between bulk and spam can sometimes be subjective. The bulk complaint level is based on the number of complaints from the sender. Decreasing the threshold can decrease the amount of perceived spam received, however, too low may be considered too strict.

#### Remediation action
Set the Bulk Complaint Level threshold to be 6.
