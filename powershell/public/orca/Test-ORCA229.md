Adding domains as trusted in Anti-phishing policy will result in the action for protected domains, protected users or mailbox intelligence protection will be not applied to messages coming from these sender domains. If a trusted domain needs to be added based on organizational requirements it should be reviewed regularly and updated as needed. We also do not recommend adding domains from shared services.
