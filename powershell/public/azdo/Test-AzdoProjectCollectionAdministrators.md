Project Collection Administrator is a highly privileged role, and membership should be restricted.

Rationale: Description of Project Collection Administrators:
- Hold the highest authority within an organization or project collection.
- Perform all operations for the entire collection.
- Manage settings, policies, and processes for the organization.
- Create and manage all projects and extensions.

#### Remediation action:
Restrict access to the Project Collection Administrators group.
Preferably use privileged access management to provide auditing and just-in-time access.
