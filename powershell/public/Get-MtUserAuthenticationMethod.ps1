.SYNOPSIS
  Get the authentication methods for the specified user

.DESCRIPTION
  Get the authentication method from the /users/{id}/authentication/methods endpoint and
  appends the `typeDisplayName` and `isMfa` properties to each authentication method.

  The user authentication method returned by Graph is missing key information such as the
  display name and whether an auth method is a multi-factor authentication method or not.

  This cmdlet also returns an IsMfa status for the overall user object and is set to true
  if the user has at least one MFA method enabled.

  Note: The overall IsMfa status may not be accurate in tenants that identity federation
  or authentication methods like Certificate Based Authentication that don't have a state
  registered against the user object.

.EXAMPLE
  Get-MtUserAuthenticationMethod -UserId 'john@contoso.com'

  # Get the authentication methods for the specified user
