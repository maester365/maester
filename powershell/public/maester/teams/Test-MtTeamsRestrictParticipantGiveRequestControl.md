This test checks the Org-wide default meeting policy is configured to only allow users in the **Presenter** role to request control and share content during meetings.

Restricting who can present limits meeting disruptions and reduces the risk of unwanted or inappropriate content being shared.

#### Remediation action:

To prevent standard attendees from sharing content during Teams meetings:

1. Click here to open [**Org-wide default settings > Meetings**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/one-policy/settings/meeting)
   * Or navigate to [Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).
   * Click **Settings & policies > Org-wide default settings > Meetings**.
1. Scroll to the **Content sharing** section.
1. Set **Participants can give or request control** to **Off**.
1. Click Save.
