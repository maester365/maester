7.2.11 (L1) Ensure the SharePoint default sharing link permission is set

Description:
This setting configures the permission that is selected by default for sharing link from a SharePoint site. The recommended state is View.

Rationale:
Setting the view permission as the default ensures that users must deliberately select the edit permission when sharing a link. This approach reduces the risk of unintentionally granting edit privileges to a resource that only requires read access, supporting the principle of least privilege.
