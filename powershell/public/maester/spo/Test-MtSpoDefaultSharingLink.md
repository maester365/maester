7.2.7 (L1) Ensure link sharing is restricted in SharePoint and OneDrive

Description:
This setting sets the default link type that a user will see when sharing content in OneDrive or SharePoint. It does not restrict or exclude any other options.
The recommended state is Specific people (only the people the user specifies) or Only people in your organization (more restrictive).

Rationale:
By defaulting to specific people, the user will first need to consider whether or not the content being shared should be accessible by the entire organization versus select individuals. This aids in reinforcing the concept of least privilege.
