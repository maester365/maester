Ensure device clean-up rule is configured

This test checks if the device clean-up rule is configured.

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://intune.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Devices** scroll down to **Organize devices**.
3. Select **Device clean-up rules**.
4. Set **Delete devices based on last check-in date** to **Yes**
5. Set **Delete devices that havenâ€™t checked in for this many days** to **30 days or more** depending on your organizational needs.
6. Click **Save**.
