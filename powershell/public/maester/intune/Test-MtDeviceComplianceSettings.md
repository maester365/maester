Ensure the built-in Device Compliance Policy marks devices with no compliance policy assigned as 'Not compliant'.

Set your Intune built-in Device Compliance Policy to mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as 'Not compliant'.
This ensures that new devices that do not have any policies assigned are not compliant per default.

#### Remediation action:

To change the built-in device compliance policy:
1. Navigate to [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://intune.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Devices** scroll down to **Manage devices**.
3. Select **Compliance** and Select **Compliance settings**.
4. Set **Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as** to **Not compliant**
5. Click **Save**.
