AI agents should not be orphaned without an active owner.

Agents whose owners have been disabled or deleted in Entra ID lack active governance. No one is responsible for maintaining their configuration, reviewing their security settings, or responding to incidents involving the agent.

### How to fix

Assign an active user as the owner of each orphaned agent in Copilot Studio. If the agent is no longer needed, unpublish or delete it.
