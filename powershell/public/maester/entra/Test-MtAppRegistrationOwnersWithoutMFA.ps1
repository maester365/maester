.SYNOPSIS
    Check if owners of app registrations have MFA enabled.
.DESCRIPTION
    This test checks all app registration owners to ensure they have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.
    App registrations without owners or with owners lacking MFA present security risks.
.EXAMPLE
    Test-MtAppRegistrationOwnersMFA
    Returns true if all app registration owners have MFA enabled, otherwise returns false.
