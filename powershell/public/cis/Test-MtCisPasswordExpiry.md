1.3.1 (L1) Ensure the 'Password expiration policy' is set to 'Set passwords to never expire (recommended)'

Organizations such as NIST and Microsoft have updated their password policy recommendations to not arbitrarily require users to change their passwords after a specific amount of time, unless there is evidence that the password is compromised, or the user forgot it.

#### Remediation action:

To set Office 365 passwords are set to never expire:
1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Click to expand **Settings** select **Org Settings**.
3. Click on **Security & privacy**.
4. Check the **Set passwords to never expire (recommended)** box.
