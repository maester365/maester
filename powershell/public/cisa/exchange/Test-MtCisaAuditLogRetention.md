Audit logs SHALL be maintained for at least the minimum duration dictated by OMB M-21-31 (Appendix C).

Rationale: Audit logs may no longer be available when needed if they are not retained for a sufficient time. Increased log retention time gives an agency the necessary visibility to investigate incidents that occurred some time ago. OMB M-21-13, Appendix C, Table 5 specifically calls out Unified Audit Logs in the Cloud Azure log category.

#### Remediation action:

To create one or more custom audit retention policies, if the default retention policy is not sufficient for agency needs, follow [Create an audit log retention policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=microsoft-purview-portal#create-an-audit-log-retention-policy) instructions. Ensure the duration selected in the retention policies is at least one year, in accordance with OMB M-21-31.
