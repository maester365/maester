Alerts SHOULD be sent to a monitored address or incorporated into a security information and event management (SIEM) system.

Rationale: Suspicious or malicious events, if not resolved promptly, may have a greater impact to users and the agency. Sending alerts to a monitored email address or SIEM system helps ensure these suspicious or malicious events are acted upon in a timely manner to limit overall impact.

#### Remediation action:

1. Sign in to **Microsoft 365 Defender**.
2. Select [**Settings**](https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings).
3. Select either:
    a. [**Microsoft Sentinel**](https://security.microsoft.com/sentinel/settings).
    b. **Defender XDR**, and under **General**, select [**Streaming API**](https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/defender/raw_data_export).
4. Ensure a SIEM integration is configured for your organization.
