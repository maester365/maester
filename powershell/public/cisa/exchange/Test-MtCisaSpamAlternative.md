If a third-party party filtering solution is used, the solution SHOULD offer services comparable to the native spam filtering offered by Microsoft.

Rationale: Spam is a constant threat as junk mail can reduce user productivity, fill up mailboxes unnecessarily, and in some cases include malicious links or attachments. Filtering out spam reduces user workload burden, prevents junk mail congestion, and reduces potentially malicious content exposure.

#### Remediation action:

1. Sign in to **Microsoft 365 Defender**.
2. In the left-hand menu, go to **Email & Collaboration** > **Policies & Rules**.
3. Select **Threat Policies**.
4. From the **Templated policies** section, select [**Preset Security Policies**](https://security.microsoft.com/presetSecurityPolicies).
5. Under **Standard protection**, slide the toggle switch to the right so the text next to the toggle reads **Standard protection is on**.
6. Under **Strict protection**, slide the toggle switch to the right so the text next to the toggle reads **Strict protection is on**.

Note: If the toggle slider in step 5 is grayed out, click on **Manage protection settings** instead and configure the policy settings according to [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to assign Standard and Strict preset security policies to users | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies?view=o365-worldwide#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users).
