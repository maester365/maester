Allowed domains SHALL NOT be added to inbound anti-spam protection policies.

Rationale: Legitimate emails may be incorrectly filtered by spam protections. Adding allowed senders is an acceptable method of combating these false positives. Allowing an entire domain, especially a common domain like office.com, however, provides for a large number of potentially unknown users to bypass spam protections.

#### Remediation action:

1. Sign in to **Microsoft 365 Defender**.
2. In the left-hand menu, go to **Email & Collaboration** > **Policies & Rules**.
3. Select **Threat Policies**.
4. From the **Templated policies** section, select [**Preset Security Policies**](https://security.microsoft.com/presetSecurityPolicies).
5. Under **Standard protection**, slide the toggle switch to the right so the text next to the toggle reads **Standard protection is on**.
6. Under **Strict protection**, slide the toggle switch to the right so the text next to the toggle reads **Strict protection is on**.

Note: If the toggle slider in step 5 is grayed out, click on **Manage protection settings** instead and configure the policy settings according to [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to assign Standard and Strict preset security policies to users | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies?view=o365-worldwide#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users).
