External sender warnings SHALL be implemented.

Rationale: Phishing is an ever-present threat. Alerting users when email originates from outside their organization can encourage them to exercise increased caution, especially if an email is one they expected from an internal sender.

#### Remediation action:

To create a mail flow rule to produce external sender warnings:
1. Sign in to the **Exchange admin center**.
2. Under **Mail flow**, select [**Rules**](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/transportrules).
3. Click the plus (+) button to create a new rule.
4. Select **Modify messages…**.
5. Give the rule an appropriate name.
6. Under **Apply this rule if…**, select **The sender is external/internal**.
7. Under **select sender location**, select **Outside the organization**, then click **OK**.
8. Under **Do the following…**, select **Prepend the subject of the message with…**.
9. Under **specify subject prefix**, enter a message such as "[External]" (without the quotation marks), then click **OK**.
10. Click **Next**.
11. Under **Choose a mode for this rule**, select **Enforce**.
12. Leave the **Severity** as **Not Specified**.
13. Leave the **Match sender address in message** as **Header** and click **Next**.
14. Click **Finish** and then **Done**.
15. The new rule will be disabled. Re-select the new rule to show its settings and slide the **Enable or disable rule** slider to the right until it shows as **Enabled**.
