The phishing protection solution SHOULD include an AI-based phishing detection tool comparable to EOP Mailbox Intelligence.

Rationale: Phishing attacks can result in unauthorized data disclosure and unauthorized access. Using AI-based phishing detection tools to improve the detection rate of phishing attempts helps reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks.

#### Remediation action:

1. Sign in to **Microsoft 365 Defender**.
2. In the left-hand menu, go to **Email & Collaboration** > **Policies & Rules**.
3. Select **Threat Policies**.
4. From the **Templated policies** section, select **Preset Security Policies**.
5. Under **Standard protection**, slide the toggle switch to the right so the text next to the toggle reads **Standard protection is on**.
6. Under **Strict protection**, slide the toggle switch to the right so the text next to the toggle reads **Strict protection is on**.

Note: If the toggle slider in step 5 is grayed out, click on **Manage protection settings** instead and configure the policy settings according to [Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to assign Standard and Strict preset security policies to users | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/preset-security-policies?view=o365-worldwide#use-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal-to-assign-standard-and-strict-preset-security-policies-to-users).
