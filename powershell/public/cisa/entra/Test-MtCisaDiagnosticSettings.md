Security logs SHALL be sent to the agency's security operations center for monitoring.

Rationale: The security risk of not having visibility into cyber attacks is reduced by collecting logs in the agencyâ€™s centralized security detection infrastructure. This makes security events available for auditing, query, and incident response.

Note: The following logs (configured in Entra diagnostic settings), are required: `AuditLogs`, `SignInLogs`, `RiskyUsers`, `UserRiskEvents`, `NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs`, `ServicePrincipalSignInLogs`, `ADFSSignInLogs`, `RiskyServicePrincipals`, `ServicePrincipalRiskEvents`, `EnrichedOffice365AuditLogs`, `MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs`. If managed identities are used for Azure resources, also send the `ManagedIdentitySignInLogs` log type. If the Entra ID Provisioning Service is used to provision users to software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps or other systems, also send the `ProvisioningLogs` log type.

Note: Agencies can benefit from security detection capabilities offered by the CISA Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW) system. Agencies are urged to send the logs to CLAW. Contact CISA at cyberliason@cisa.dhs.gov to request integration instructions.

#### Remediation action:

Follow the configuration instructions unique to the products and integration patterns at your organization to send the security logs to the security operations center for monitoring.
