The authentication methods SMS, Voice Call, and Email One-Time Passcode (OTP) SHALL be disabled.

Rationale: SMS, voice call, and email OTP are the weakest authenticators. This policy forces users to use stronger MFA methods.

#### Remediation action:

If phishing-resistant MFA has not been deployed yet and Microsoft Authenticator is in use, configure Authenticator to display context information to users when they log in.

1. In **Azure Active Directory**, click **Security** > **[Authentication methods](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/AuthenticationMethodsMenuBlade/~/AdminAuthMethods/fromNav/Identity)**
2. Click on the **SMS**, **Voice Call**, and **Email OTP** authentication methods and disable each of them. Their statuses should be **Enabled** > **No** on the **Authentication methods** > **Policies** page.
