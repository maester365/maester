External sharing for SharePoint SHALL be limited to Existing guests or Only People in your organization.

Rationale: Sharing information outside the organization via SharePoint increases the risk of unauthorized access. By limiting external sharing, administrators decrease the risk of access to information.

#### Remediation action:

1. Sign in to the [SharePoint admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219).
2. Select Policies > Sharing.
3. Adjust external sharing slider for SharePoint to Existing guests or Only people in your organization.

> ⚠️ WARNING: This will break existing sharing.

4. Select Save.
