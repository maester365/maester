Attackers who gain access to these credentials (e.g., by infostealer) can impersonate privileged users, bypass Conditional Access, and access sensitive the assigned sensitive roles. Protecting endpoints, especially used by privileged users, is essential to prevent unauthorized access and reduce attack surface.

### How to fix
