Group and team owners can authorize applications, such as applications published by third-party vendors, to access your organization's data associated with a group. For example, a team owner in Microsoft Teams can allow an app to read all Teams messages in the team, or list the basic profile of a group's members.

CISA SCuBA 2.7: Non-Admin Users SHALL Be Prevented From Providing Consent To Third-Party Applications.
