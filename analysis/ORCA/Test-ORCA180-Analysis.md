## Original Documentation

When the sender email address is spoofed, the message appears to originate from someone or somewhere other than the actual source. Anti-spoofing protection examines forgery of the 'From: header' which is the one that shows up in an email client like Outlook. It is recommended to enable anti-spoofing protection in Office 365 Anti-phishing policies.

#### Remediation action
Enable anti-spoofing protection in Anti-phishing policy.
