Public projects **should be** disabled.

Rationale: When you choose public visibility, anyone on the internet can view your project. With private visibility, only users you give access to can view your project.

#### Remediation action:
Disable the policy to stop these requests and notifications.
1. Sign in to your organization.
2. Choose Organization settings.
3. Select Policies under the Security section
4. Locate the "Allow public projects" policy and toggle it to off.

**Results:**
External users are not able to access your project.
