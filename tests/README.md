This folder contains the tests that Maester will run to validate your environment. The tests are organized into the following folders:

- **Custom**: Place your custom Pester tests in this directory. The file name should end with `.Tests.ps1`.
- **CIS**: Contains the tests that verifies the tenant's configuration conforms to the guidelines identified by the [Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_365).
- **CISA**: Contains the tests that verifies the tenantâ€™s configuration conforms to the policies described in the Secure Cloud Business Applications ([SCuBA](https://cisa.gov/scuba)) Security Configuration Baseline [documents](https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGear/blob/main/baselines/README.md).
- **EIDSCA**: Contains tests based on the [Entra ID Security Config Analyzer](https://maester.dev/docs/tests/eidsca/).

## Customizing Severity Levels

### Customizing Severity Levels for Out of the Box Tests

You can customize the severity levels of the out of the box tests tests.

To do this create a file named `maester-config.json` in your `./Custom` folder.

Provide the severity levels for the tests you want to customize, using the format below.

The severity levels are:

- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low
- Info

```json
{
    "TestSettings": [
        {
            "Id": "CIS.M365.1.1.1",
            "Severity": "High"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Defining severity levels for custom tests

You can define severity levels for your custom tests using the above approach (`maester-config.json`) or by using the `-Tag` parameter in the `Describe` or `It` block of your Pester tests.

The tag needs to be in the format of `Severity:<SeverityLevel>`.

E.g.

```powershell
Describe 'My Custom Test' {
    It 'Cus.1001: My custom test' -Tag 'Severity:High' {
        # Your test code here
    }
}
```

If a Severity level is defined in both the `maester-config.json` file and the test, the one in the `./Custom/maester-config.json` will take precedence.
