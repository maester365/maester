Checks that the cloud extended timeout is configured between 30-50 seconds in the assigned Microsoft Defender Antivirus policies.

Insufficient cloud timeout may prevent thorough analysis of suspicious files, allowing potentially malicious content to bypass cloud-based detection.

#### Remediation action:

1. Open [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com) > **Endpoint Security** > **Antivirus**
2. Edit the relevant Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy
3. Set **Cloud Extended Timeout** to 30-50 seconds

If your antivirus settings are split across several policies, this setting only needs to be set in one of them, as long as that policy is assigned to every device that needs it. No other assigned policy should set a different value: Intune does not merge this setting, so a device that receives both values may end up with either one, or none.
