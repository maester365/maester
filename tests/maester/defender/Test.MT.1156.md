Verify that scanning network files is enabled despite SMB load considerations.

Disabled network file scanning creates attack vectors through shared files.

#### Remediation action:

1. Open [Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://endpoint.microsoft.com) > **Endpoint Security** > **Antivirus**
2. Edit the relevant Microsoft Defender Antivirus policy
3. Enable **Allow Scanning Network Files**

If your antivirus settings are split across several policies, this setting only needs to be set in one of them, as long as that policy is assigned to every device that needs it. No other assigned policy should set a different value: Intune does not merge this setting, so a device that receives both values may end up with either one, or none.
