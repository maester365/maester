## Use as GitHub action

Maester is also published to the [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-maester) and can be used directly in any GitHub workflow. Because it is specially built for GitHub, it nicely integrates with all the features of GitHub Actions, like uploading artifacts and writing a summary to the workflow run.

For more details, please refer to the [docs](https://maester.dev/docs/monitoring/github/) or the [action repository](https://github.com/maester365/maester-action).

```yaml

  schedule:
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"
  # Allows to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
