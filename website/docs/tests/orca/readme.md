# ORCA Controls

## Overview

The Microsoft Defender for [Office 365 Recommended Configuration Analyzer (ORCA)](https://github.com/cammurray/orca) tool is an implementation of Microsoft's [Recommended settings for EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/recommended-settings-for-eop-and-office365). The tests in this section align with this intent.

## Connecting to Azure, Exchange and other services

In order to run all the ORCA tests, you need to install and connect to the Azure and Exchange Online modules.

See the [Installation guide](/docs/installation#optional-modules-and-permissions) for more information.
